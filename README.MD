This git repo will document all the changes made in each commit

Goals:
- Create state machine for disarmed, stay, and away modes using if statements. Also switch stay and away behaviors to match assignment
- Change button check for each state and add tamper mode
- Change door sensor polarity; it should not alarm when the LED is shining on it
- change scan servo method (random scan would be harder to sneak around)
